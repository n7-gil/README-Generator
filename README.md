# README-Generator

[Link]: https://github.com/n7-gil/README-Generator

The purpose of this assignment was to make a README generator through node.js instead of having to make new files via Visual Studio Code. Prompts will be presented via node index.js and you answer the prompts, then creating a new README file based on your responses.
